 Method of implementation displaying routines
==============================================

API for manipulation on memory buffer. This memory buffer reflects lines
and characters on display.

char display_buffer[4][20]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working routine, copies charaters from display buffer to display in loop.
This allows easily working on display content, but prevents system from latency
during sending text on display.

Implemented as state machine, which leaves to ther part of code in every
internal loop iteration.

States:
-IDLE		awaiting buffer change
-WRITE		writing character from buffer
-NEXTLINE	reaching end of line, so go next line
-CORNER		reaching end of display, so go fist line
